# coffee-shop-finder-website
a web page for checking London cafes, to see if they have wifi/sockets etc. 

made using Flask, FlaskForms, Jinja, a sqlalchemy database, and utilising a Bootstrap template.

I wanted the site to have a simple, clean look, with a coffee theme and colouring.

each cafe has a seperate page, clickable from the card.

and a FlaskForm to enter a new cafe, which will then be displayed on the main page.


# What I have learnt

using a template meant there was a lot of CSS and HTML code already in the program. So when I wanted to change anything, it meant digging into the pages of code to find what I wanted to change. This was frustating at first, but with hard work I became more comfortable doing so. I feel I have a better understanding of CSS and HTML now.

I feel more confident making web pages now.

# What I would like to improve

- there are still unused links/parts of the pages that came with the template, so I will remove those.

- add map links

- a more longer-term improvement, but I would like to learn Javascript. I wanted to add an interactive google maps element, that showed the location of the cafe, but without Javascript this is not posible, and I didn't feel capable of making something makeshift.
